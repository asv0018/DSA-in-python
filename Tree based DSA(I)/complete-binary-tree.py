#the main difference between complete binary tree
#and full binary tree is that,complete binary tree
#should have all the leaf element to left
#full binary tree is expected to have either 2 childrens
#or no children.

#therefore the difference lies here all the complete
#binary tree need not be a full binary tree and viceversa
